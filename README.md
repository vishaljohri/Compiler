# Compiler
Language: TinyPyC
Designing high level language and it's run-time

This project deals with designing high level language which uses concepts of well known languages like Python and C.
Antlr is used for compiling the source code and generating intermediate code.
Run-time is written in Python.

File for High-Level code has extension .hpc and intermediate code has extension .bpc

Examples to Compile and run-programs:
-----------------------------------
1 ) java -jar TinyPyCAntlrCompiler.jar RecursionFactorial.hpc

2) python TinyPyCInterpreter.py RecursionFactorial.bpc

PS: We have shared few examples programs in ExampleCode folder.
